    "The goal of this project was to find averages for different regions, genders, smoker statuses, bmis, number of children, and ages. Once the data was imported and stored, those averages were found and then compared to the overall average of the dataset. It was noted wether a particular group was above or below the average and the numerical difference between the two. Future analysis could be used to determine which factor causes the most change in the charges. There are some groupd in this set that do not have a large number of individuals which could inpact the analysis so further investigation or more data is necessary to avoid certain baises that are inherently present in the dataset provided.
